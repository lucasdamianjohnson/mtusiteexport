 MTU Site Export Code - Exporting to OU Campus
When I first started for UMC  they were using Rythmx which was an older Java-based CMS. I was tasked to find a way to export all the sites into files that OU Campus could read. So, I made this script that takes a site map and grabs all the necessary data and produces a copy of the site that can be simply uploaded to OU Campus.
